# Building EstimatePro APK - Complete Instructions

## Prerequisites Required

Your project is a Kivy application that needs to be converted to APK. Since you're on Windows, you have several options:

## Option 1: Build on Cloud (EASIEST & FASTEST - RECOMMENDED)

I'll create a GitHub Actions workflow that will automatically build your APK whenever you push to GitHub:

### Steps:
1. Create a GitHub repository
2. Push your project code
3. The workflow will automatically build the APK
4. Download the APK from GitHub Actions artifacts

**Advantages:**
- No local setup needed
- Builds are consistent
- Free for public repositories

## Option 2: Use WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux)

### Installation Steps:
1. Open PowerShell as Administrator
2. Run: `wsl --install`
3. Restart your computer
4. Open Ubuntu from Start Menu
5. Follow the build steps below

### Build Steps in WSL:
```bash
# Navigate to your project
cd /mnt/c/Users/Hp/Desktop/myproject

# Install dependencies
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y python3-pip python3-venv openjdk-17-jdk git zip unzip libffi-dev libssl-dev liblzma-dev zlib1g-dev

# Create virtual environment
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install cython buildozer

# Build APK
buildozer android debug
```

## Option 3: Use Online Build Service

Use services like:
- **Buildozer Online**: https://github.com/joerodrigues/buildozer-online
- **Gitpod**: https://gitpod.io

## Option 4: Manual Build with Docker

```bash
docker pull kivy/buildozer
docker run -v "%cd%:/app" kivy/buildozer android debug
```

## Your buildozer.spec Configuration

I've already updated your buildozer.spec with the following optimizations:

✅ **All Dependencies Included**:
- python3, kivy
- pyrebase4, requests, urllib3, certifi, chardet, idna (for Firebase integration)
- All network libraries for authentication

✅ **Assets Included**:
- All .jpg images from root directory
- All assets from assests/ folder
- All screen modules

✅ **Android Configuration**:
- Min API: 21 (Android 5.0+)
- Target API: 33 (Android 13)
- Architecture: arm64-v8a (compatible with all modern devices)

## Next Steps

Choose your preferred option and let me know. I recommend **Option 1 (GitHub Actions)** for the easiest build process.

If you want me to set up the GitHub Actions workflow automatically, just say "yes" and I'll create all the necessary files!
